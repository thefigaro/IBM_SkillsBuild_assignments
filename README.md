## Introduction to data science 
- [Data Science Tools and Ecosystem](DataScienceEcosystem.ipynb)   
  An introduction to the uses and features of Jupyter Notebook
- [Project: House Sales in King County, USA](House_Sales_in_King_Count_USA-20231003-1696291200.jupyterlite.ipynb)   
  In this project, we highlight some of the most important modules used in data science within the Python ecosystem, including NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The commits for this project involved utilizing historical house pricing data to explore and fit the data to various models.
- [Project part I: Graphics Visualizations in Python ](DV0101EN-Final-Assignment-Part1-v2.ipynb)   
  We create and explore visualizations using Matplotib, Seaborn and Folium for mapping. 
- [Project part II: Graphics Visualizations in Python](DV0101EN-Final-Assign-Part-2-Questions_last.py)   
  In this section of the project, we create a dashboard using Dash and Plotly.
- [Project: Scrapping and Visualizing Stock Data](Final%20Assignment.ipynb)   
  This project consist in 2 parts:  
  1. We extract the stock price of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance module. Additionally, we utilize BeautifulSoup to scrape and refine the data extraction process.
  2. Next, we performed various computations and transformations using Pandas to analyze and visualize stock prices, allowing for effective comparisons within the stock market.

- [Final Project: Classification with Python](ML0101EN_SkillUp_FinalAssignment.jupyterlite.ipynb)   
In this project, we implemented several fundamental machine learning algorithms for classification, including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

- [Assignment: Notebook for Graded Assessment](mod5-final-project-v2.ipynb)   
The assignment involves socio-economic data from the city of Chicago. We load three datasets into separate tables within a SQLite database and execute SQL queries to address the questions posed in the assignment.

## Data Science Capstone
-[SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage Landing Prediction](Data%20Science%20Capstone/01_SpaceX_Data_Collection_API.ipynb)
In this capstone project, we aim to predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises its Falcon 9 rocket launches at a cost of $62 million, significantly lower than other providers, which charge upwards of $165 million per launch. A substantial portion of these savings is attributed to SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting the success of the first stage landing, we can gain insights into the overall cost-effectiveness of a launch.
